# Building a Real-time Cache System with Docker, Kafka, and NiFi

This repository showcases the construction of a complete data pipeline and cache system.  Following the architecture described in the linked article, this project serves as a practical example of building a modern, scalable, and real-time data solution using leading open-source technologies.

## **Project Highlights:**

* **Architectural Blueprint:** Implements a multi-component architecture including database clusters, message brokers, data flow management, and caching layers.
* **Hands-on Docker Deployment:**  Provides a Docker Compose setup for easy deployment and experimentation with distributed systems.
* **Data Streaming with Kafka:**  Illustrates the use of Kafka for building robust and fault-tolerant data pipelines.
* **Visual Data Processing with NiFi:**  Demonstrates Apache NiFi's capabilities in designing and managing complex data flows.
* **Real-time Data Updates:**  Implements real-time data updates using WebSockets and Pusher to reflect database changes in a web application.

The architectureâ€™s design is the following :
